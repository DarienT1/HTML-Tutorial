      <h1> This is a heading! They go from 1-6 and this is h1, the biggest.</h1>

      <h6> This is h6, the smallest.<h6>

      <p> This is a paragraph!</p>

      <h2>Lists!</h2>

      <p>Next up is an unordered list</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (It stands for unordered List)</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
        <li> They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Anything in the "ul" element should be inside "li" tags for example if you want to put a "p" tag you must first surround it with "li"</p>

      <p>Now we are on to Ordered Lists</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Notice there is now an "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
        <li>But, the list items "li" are the same</li>
        <li>Also note how the numebrs increment on their own</li>
        <li>You should be noticing theses items in this precise order because it is an ordered list!</li>
      </ol>

      <h2> Inline Elements</h2>

      <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attentiont to a specific word or phrase.</p>

      <p>This is some <em>emphasized text</em></p>

      <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase</p>

      <p><strong><em>and sometimes you need to shout!</em></strong></p>

      <h2> Empty Elements </h2>
